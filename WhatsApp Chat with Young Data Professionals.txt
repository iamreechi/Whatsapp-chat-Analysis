08/10/2019, 9:29 pm - +234 909 778 5164: *Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid?*
Ans)I’m a student from India and want to learn Blockchain Technology. I
think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry
the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my
scholarship,it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money
for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without
any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of
this financial aid.I want to take this course as I want to learn.This
Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It
will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and
give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach
credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.I plan to
complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous
Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums,
which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online
courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which
are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning
opportunity.
*Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?*
Ans)My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and
to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and
improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this
Blockchain Technology and also to implement it. It can help me advance in
my knowledge.This course will help me in defining Blockchain
Technology,understanding how Blockchain could potentially impact our
business and industry,to write a thought leadership piece regarding use
cases and industry potential of Blockchain technology,explain Blockchain
Technology to clients, friends,joining a community of economists, business
leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology
as we speak.Identifying which aspects of Blockchain Technology seem most
important and relevant to us,Walking away with a strong foundation in where
blockchain is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Blockchain
course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to
greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past.
*Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.*
Ans)Simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my
education, I can invest only my time now.

09/10/2019, 9:02 am - +27 82 780 8535: since with official udemy  course you have to connect online to access or download to your device. and this one is about 5Gigs, as for the ethical issues, not interested in discussing that

09/10/2019, 9:39 am - +27 82 780 8535: Udemy does what's called dynamic pricing, say you already have an account with them they have collected data on you to estimate what price you are likely to pay for the course, they even factor your device coz I've noticed that if i look at a course with my ipad the price can be different when using my phone and FYI of course dynamic pricing uses machine learning, am sure most of you know that 🤣

05/11/2019, 8:34 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Same here
05/11/2019, 8:35 pm - Goodnews Ds: Didn't get any reply ooo
05/11/2019, 8:35 pm - Goodnews Ds: 🤷🏽‍♀
05/11/2019, 8:37 pm - Richie: Without consulting google F1 is a test of accuracy test of etc 😊lets take a case of image recognition of waste recognition. After training your model to identify different kinds of waste from 100 images the model selected 50 as waste 60 as not waste... False positive is those one that were  nlt waste that it did  select and False negative were those that was waste that it actually didn't select True positive does that are waste that it identified and True negative those that were  waste that it didn't select.. All other things can be gotten from Google... I stand to be corrected
05/11/2019, 8:39 pm - Richie: Its actually 50 50 not 50 60..
05/11/2019, 8:38 pm - +234 909 778 5164: 🤞🏽
05/11/2019, 8:39 pm - +234 813 780 3722: I didn't get any reply too after submitting the form
05/11/2019, 8:39 pm - Opaino: Is f1 score actually a test of accuracy?
05/11/2019, 8:40 pm - Opaino: It's actually an harmonic mean of both precision and recall which gives you more of a balance in judging your model performance base on the case study. 

My boss abi
05/11/2019, 8:42 pm - Richie: Harmonic mean yes but I think it still test accuracy some how.. But there is lots of bias to f1 score and some people argued not to trust its judgement
05/11/2019, 8:42 pm - Richie: Biko let the ogas clear thr air na...
05/11/2019, 8:45 pm - Opaino: If you say test of accuracy as a metric might not be true but it's definitely an evaluation metric to check her accurate a model performs.

Bias you mean?
05/11/2019, 8:45 pm - Opaino: ~her~
*How
05/11/2019, 8:46 pm - +234 816 381 5935: ✍✍✍🏿✍🏿
05/11/2019, 8:48 pm - Opaino: I would actually love to hear what you meant by  bias because depending on the problem at hand you might have a model with high *precision* and very *low recall* which might not be good so I believe that's where *F1 & Fbeta score* comes in to find a balance
05/11/2019, 8:49 pm - Opaino: @2348028259007 

Our oga Pycon boss
05/11/2019, 8:49 pm - Opaino: Come and say something

Make I cast you 😀
05/11/2019, 8:50 pm - Richie: Ok well maybe i should have constructed the grammar to measure a test accuracy
05/11/2019, 8:51 pm - Richie: See this from what i Google
What is the F Score?
The F score, also called the F1 score or F measure, is a measure of a test’s accuracy. The F score is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of the test’s precision and recall.
05/11/2019, 8:53 pm - Richie: Ok i can't remember where i got the write up from but its been bias is from the computation error by F1 score the author was referring to
05/11/2019, 8:54 pm - Richie: Either bias is the right expression or been inaccurate sef but will check that material again
05/11/2019, 8:55 pm - Opaino: Maybe bias as to determining what is to be varied because from my knowledge of how f1 score is interpreted you either increase it closer to Recall with a corresponding impact of decrease on precision, maybe that's where the bias comes in to determine which of the 2 metrics should be favored.

You can check it out and share the link when you find it so we can learn
05/11/2019, 8:55 pm - Opaino: Please do and share
05/11/2019, 8:56 pm - Richie: Ok bro
05/11/2019, 8:58 pm - Richie: Jx imagine you went for an interview and this happens to be the questions they ask you😊.. Today wont be easily forgotten..
05/11/2019, 8:59 pm - Richie: Maybe we should be giving the house an algorithm to go study and we come and discuss its relevance, pros, cons etc... Not that we are applying it but jx having a good understanding of it..@2348108522573 what do yoj think
05/11/2019, 9:04 pm - Opaino: This is a norm na 😀😀😀
05/11/2019, 9:05 pm - Opaino: I have had Interview that I fuck up with EY
05/11/2019, 9:05 pm - Opaino: That's when I learnt lesson to understand the fundamentals well and not just the fanciful Algorithms 😊
05/11/2019, 9:06 pm - Opaino: The DS manager asked me how Decision tree work explaining it with Entropy
05/11/2019, 9:06 pm - Opaino: 😀
05/11/2019, 9:06 pm - Opaino: Mehn I stammer that day o😀😀

Decision tree that one will just import from sklearn 😀😀
05/11/2019, 9:07 pm - Richie: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
05/11/2019, 9:07 pm - Richie: I need to be going for interviews ohh even if i don't neef the job yet🤔
05/11/2019, 9:08 pm - Opaino: I'm serious 😀😀

Ordinary 

From sklearn.ensemble import DecisionTree 

You go build model without paying attention to what's happening under the hood and how it work
05/11/2019, 9:08 pm - Richie: Navie bayesian nko
05/11/2019, 9:09 pm - Richie: And there are plenty
05/11/2019, 9:10 pm - Richie: Lets help ourselves with the fundamental learning... At least it will make the group more lively
05/11/2019, 9:13 pm - Richie: Interviewer: i see you know alot about ML and etc so tell me all you know of xgboost and hyperparameter when you are done explain data leakage before we give you a dataset to manipulate...

Me; can i use my laptop 🤔🤔 🚶🏾🚶🏾🚶🏾..job interview closed...
05/11/2019, 9:14 pm - Opaino: Mehn after that experience I went back to go and understand all the basics, why this is that , all the why's I dig am o😀😀

05/11/2019, 9:16 pm - Richie: Lmao i love this look because that will be my look to the person....
05/11/2019, 9:17 pm - Opaino: The man actually told me 70% of real world data ordinary linear regression will solve it that most of those fanciful Algorithms used to win Competitions aren't really used at all and that's why he ensure he ask basic and fundamental DS questions to know if the candidate can interpret the model result and not just improve model😀.

Truth be told I don't understand how catboost work all I know is it's a cheat to boost your model😀
05/11/2019, 9:19 pm - Richie: Lmao... Well explained... I will tell them exactly this😊... Catboost
05/11/2019, 9:20 pm - +234 706 499 0746: Truth be told... I think I'm lost here...

08/11/2019, 6:53 am - Opaino: No question here and no codes either
08/11/2019, 6:55 am - Opaino: Group By is used alongside Aggregate functions like "Sum, Count , Avg " etc , so any column selected not part of the Aggregated column is placed under "Groupby " and "Order by" comes last in terms of sequence so you can choose to order in ascending which is the default or add "DESC" to reverse it

12/11/2019, 9:34 am - Obinna: Yea, facts

12/11/2019, 9:46 am - Opaino: Well as the data availability increases then the power of DL will much more needed, so learning those packages won't be bad
12/11/2019, 9:47 am - Opaino: Andrew Ng mentioned it in one of the DL specialization that DL capability is maximized when there is availability of large data to train the neural networks and we know at the moment in Nigeria data availability is still a challenge
12/11/2019, 9:48 am - Obinna: Yea, I agree with you
12/11/2019, 9:51 am - Obinna: I think availability of Data is one of the major challenges of Data Scientists in Nigeria and Africa.
I've been wanting to do a major project that is specific to Nigeria but sourcing relevant data is a big challenge.

12/11/2019, 11:07 am - +234 706 197 1884: 💯
12/11/2019, 11:10 am - Richie: Today i was at an event concerning Eko carbon exchange.. And i gave a speech concerning tje various companies including a data guy in their team.. I must say most didn't or rather were not aware but after my speech most saw the need for a data scientist, ML engineer etc.. Lets hope the jobs starts coming
12/11/2019, 11:11 am - Richie: No worries here na family.. If i see any offer i will drop and if you are not a data guy and you are here.... You should think twice
12/11/2019, 11:13 am - Obinna: Data science as a career is still emerging in Nigeria. The big firms who are data driven have structured Data Science teams and if you find employment in these firms, you'll have a clear indication of your job requirements and you'll likely apply your data science skills extensively.
12/11/2019, 11:13 am - Richie: We all need to have a meet up in this group.. I have said it before and i'm saying it again... A formidable force
12/11/2019, 11:13 am - +234 816 381 5935: Yes sir.. @2349058285150
12/11/2019, 11:15 am - Richie: There are lots of projects i can say that will fetch money.. You may not even need the so called job.. Lets jx think out of the box..idea concerning waste dm me
12/11/2019, 11:17 am - Obinna: The smaller and emerging firms are just catching on the Big data buzz and are looking to integrate Data analysis into their operations. Most don't know the how data will drive their business, they just expect to hire a Data scientist who'll come in and magically use Data science to solve all their problems.
The other ones will list actual Data entry jobs as Data scientist roles.
Generally, there's a lot of orientation that Nigerian firms need to undergo to understand how to leverage Big Data, AI and Data science in their business operations.
12/11/2019, 11:20 am - Richie: That's why if you get employed as one and not doing your role.. Change the game and enlighten them.. It will be difficult but someone has to start it..

If you are Lucky to work in a firm who knows and have already data scientist know that at one time they were not knowledgeable until someone came in.. Be that someone.
12/11/2019, 11:22 am - Richie: @opino @2349038819790 @27612900591 and everyone who started this group lets have a meetup
12/11/2019, 11:23 am - Obinna: Yea, it's very important.
Collaborating and working on indigenous projects is a great way to convince firms to embrace AI.
If business owners can see indigenous projects that they can relate to and see how it's used to solve  business problems, they'll readily embrace AI.
Same applies to the government.
12/11/2019, 11:24 am - Obinna: Yea, we are basically saying the same thing.

It won't be easy but it's very possible.

12/11/2019, 11:59 am - Opaino: The last paragraph very true and it's not their fault it takes lot of investment as a business to have a data science team because DS isn't magic, the recently published KPMG report about Nigeria capability and readiness for Data Analytics is really a high opener that very soon Nigeria will be ready for the tornado of data driven organization which  is why the best time to learn is now and be a boss.

When I get the report I will share.

In all if you are in an organization not data savvy be the evangelist and preach the gospel of data, this is achieved in my previous company that I proposed projects I was going to do to leverage my skills though too bad I couldn't when other matters called me 😀
12/11/2019, 12:00 pm - Opaino: You drive it man I'm in full support 

I love your energy , so let's know how many I. Support then we can plan appropriately
12/11/2019, 12:00 pm - +234 903 881 9790: Three years ago, no one really ever thought that data science could be embraced like this in Nigeria today. Even when you look at our current situation as a nation, relevant data is very scarce. The major limitation why  this field is yet to boom. And even un thus scenerio, the growth rate of data analyst is ever on the increase.

And to be honest with most of us here on this platform, If we focus alone on learning data science as a means of securing a job without service of our nation in mind, we are doing our selves a disservice.


As a young guy with Engineering background, i could remember vividly how we  young guys like myself were running Helter and skelter to learn AutoCAD and 3d modelling softwares, but to day the story us different because company prefer someone who can solve a problem not just apply a skill. That was exactly what i  served 5 years ago and decided to launch into energy as my career. It's really painful as most of my guys that are very proficient in CAD and cam  could not make use of that skill.


Why all this?

As much as we are working to meet ends meet as individuals, what also can we do be different in this a group to ever remain relevant in this space. Don't be surprised that in three years time, the pay for the same job position might as data scientist might drop because the market will all be flooded with data scientist. And by this time only professionals in specific areas and with useful experience would be much more relevant.

This hit me really hard because ,not too soon the same will hit tge data space in Nigeria .


So I'm thinking out loud.

Can't we form a consortium renders data science services for company in Nigeria?

12/11/2019, 8:43 pm - Opaino: Hello guys ,

In response to this I must commend that it's a great one which creat room for networking and collaboration. If there is one thing that has helped me in my Data Science journey is having plethora of Data-science community and young data lovers like myself, trust me it can get boring and overwhelming but at those moments you draw strength from the community. As it stands now if I encounter any problem related to anything called "Data" , I know if I reach out to few guys I met through meetups or groups I will get an answer.


 Myself & @27612900591 have scheduled a session to come up with modalities of how the meetup should go to accommodate everyone including those not in Nigeria like our SA brethren, so after the meeting we request for volunteers to join in the planning then we can communicate the roadmap to the general house. it shouldn't be difficult to pull strings and bring guys to handle a session 😀 .


Btw anyone here that will be attending DSN AI Bootcamp let's start our meetup there as I will be there live 😀. So let's go with the vibe 🔥, some of us don't know too much but we can make noise and ginger those that know 😉. 

Untill then enjoy analytics.

Need to convert an Excel file to XML 

Anyone got any idea ?
15/11/2019, 6:53 pm - Opaino: Battled with this stuff for over 2hrs at work and boss said "Go figure it out over the weekend" 🥴
15/11/2019, 6:56 pm - Richie: Can't python do it
15/11/2019, 6:56 pm - Opaino: That's what I've been researching on o but not getting some clear headway
15/11/2019, 6:57 pm - Opaino: Funnily XML is the only file that can't be exported from pandas
15/11/2019, 6:57 pm - Richie: Ok let me try
15/11/2019, 6:57 pm - Richie: Lmao..
15/11/2019, 6:57 pm - Richie: Let mr try
15/11/2019, 6:57 pm - Opaino: You can export from pandas to JSON, HTML etc but not XML
15/11/2019, 6:57 pm - Opaino: And my task need me to export the output as an XML file
15/11/2019, 6:58 pm - Opaino: I can do it with Excel Developer tool but it will require a little manual inputation which doesn't look efficient to me and that's why I've been thinking through how to write the code to perform the task
15/11/2019, 6:58 pm - Olayinka DS: Oh
15/11/2019, 6:59 pm - Opaino: Alright bruv

https://www.zamzar.com/convert/xls-to-xml/
15/11/2019, 7:00 pm - Opaino: I saw it too bro but it will require uploading the data to the platform which might cause a data privacy breach
15/11/2019, 7:01 pm - +27 61 290 0591: Woops see what you mean🤐🤐
15/11/2019, 7:01 pm - Opaino: Because you don't know who controls the platform so that might lead to confidential data leakage to an online platform which isn't secured
15/11/2019, 7:01 pm - Opaino: Do you get?

For those that might be chanced to attend tomorrow
15/11/2019, 7:21 pm - Obinna: https://blog.udemy.com/excel-to-xml/

If your xlsx file has lots of columns, it might take time to manually update the xml schema
15/11/2019, 7:23 pm - Opaino: Exactly, you get the ooh g which is how I knew it's logically not efficient
15/11/2019, 7:23 pm - Opaino: I'm projecting working with millions of data that can't be the only way
15/11/2019, 7:37 pm - Obinna: How many columns does the file have?

The number of rows should not be an issue.
15/11/2019, 7:48 pm - Obinna: What if you convert the excel file to csv, load into a dataframe and then apply a custom function that converts to xml.

Then you dump into a file.
15/11/2019, 7:49 pm - Obinna: Check out this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18574108/how-do-convert-a-pandas-dataframe-to-xml/18576067#18576067

15/11/2019, 7:50 pm - Richie: But won't some data be affected.. I saw something like this via WQU
15/11/2019, 7:50 pm - Obinna: Explore your data, you can tweak the function to suit your needs
15/11/2019, 7:55 pm - Obinna: If there are special characters, it might.

Cleaning the data or tweaking the function should solve the problem.

I think for the different years, you should have used different colors for them, instead of the same burgundy/wine color. So as to add some light to it.

And for the case of the crimes, CAPSLOCK/UPPERCASE would have been better.

But overall, you did a great job.

Can you elucidate more on this my brain just booted
16/11/2019, 5:21 pm - +27 82 780 8535: If you give me say at least 10 made rows resembling the structure of the data and the required xml i can quickly write you a query that spits out that xml
16/11/2019, 5:23 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Basically you use for xml commands, there's about 3 variants of them
16/11/2019, 5:24 pm - Opaino: Can't release the data because of some data privacy issues, but can you use a dummy data or just give an idea about the query I should be able to understand
16/11/2019, 5:25 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Hence i said made up rows that resemble the structure, in a nutshell scrambled data
16/11/2019, 5:26 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Basically you are looking for this https://www.sqlshack.com/for-xml-path-clause-in-sql-server/
16/11/2019, 5:27 pm - +27 82 780 8535: If the data is from one table then the query is extremely easy but if you are joining which is like the case then consider yourself a master if you can figure it out within a weekend

16/11/2019, 5:34 pm - Opaino: What's the issue with Python?
16/11/2019, 5:34 pm - Richie: Lmao
16/11/2019, 5:36 pm - +27 82 780 8535: It's not too bad, just that i do not do python everyday so am taking longer than u expected say to filter a frame by dates and making sure conversions do not break

Nothing i can't handle
16/11/2019, 5:37 pm - +27 82 780 8535: The biggest question i have about python is when do we use pandas or numpy? So far am reading values from an excel file, i have imported both numpy and pandas but find mystery using pandas more
16/11/2019, 6:34 pm - +234 805 444 1077: I get what u trying to say, u want to explore pandas more👍🏿
16/11/2019, 7:20 pm - +27 82 780 8535: I just want to  know what is each good at seeing they have a lot of common features

That is from those who use them regularly

17/11/2019, 8:53 pm - +234 805 444 1077: This happened to me today and it's real.. I had an interview with a white man(German) at a hotel, he ordered for Heineken and asked what I should be given and I said trophy.. I drank 2bottles sha and the interview went well. I just want to know if I acted right
17/11/2019, 8:54 pm - +234 815 344 5898: Oyinbos are not hard about life. Like we Nigerians. They relate so well like humans and they do not pretend
17/11/2019, 8:54 pm - +234 815 344 5898: That you had trophy will not influence the interview negatively
17/11/2019, 8:55 pm - +234 805 444 1077: OK now
17/11/2019, 8:55 pm - Goodnews Ds: 👍👍👍👍u too good😊
17/11/2019, 8:57 pm - +234 805 444 1077: Babe, I cannot come and kee myself ooo😂😂
17/11/2019, 8:58 pm - Goodnews Ds: Abeg ooo, no kill ooo
17/11/2019, 9:06 pm - +234 703 160 7868: Drinking beer and even two bottles isn't actually the issue. You may have acted right by being yourself, but there was a little mistake you made.
17/11/2019, 9:07 pm - +234 805 444 1077: Which mistake is that bro
17/11/2019, 9:08 pm - +234 703 160 7868: That very beer brand you ordered.
17/11/2019, 9:08 pm - +234 805 444 1077: Is trophy not drink?
17/11/2019, 9:08 pm - +234 816 042 7544: 😂😂😂
17/11/2019, 9:09 pm - +234 703 160 7868: It is...But trophy is regarded as a competition to Heineken.
17/11/2019, 9:10 pm - +234 808 815 7072: This is relative to the interviewer. I once got a job after the interviewer asked if I drink and smoke and my ansa was ocassionally. So I doubt if anything is wrong with having a drink with during/after an interview with your interviewer
17/11/2019, 9:10 pm - +234 815 344 5898: Lol
17/11/2019, 9:10 pm - +234 815 344 5898: It doesn't matter which brand he took
17/11/2019, 9:12 pm - +234 703 160 7868: Another thing Heineken is seen as a premium brand globally. And when people see you drink it, there is an immediate perception attached to your personality.
17/11/2019, 9:15 pm - +234 703 160 7868: I didn't say anything was wrong with drinking. She was being herself which is perfectly cool.
17/11/2019, 9:16 pm - +234 808 815 7072: ✌
17/11/2019, 9:22 pm - +234 902 233 9854: 😂😂😂😂

17/11/2019, 9:51 pm - +234 803 263 4711: Our data abi our time🤦🏾‍♀
17/11/2019, 9:53 pm - Richie: Concerning the interview case
🤔.. Its not absolute in every case..what if you stopped drink alcohol like me💁🏽‍♂.. So i will order Heineken because he took it bar👏🏽... Its either i take my Malta in peace and thank God for a nice drink or i don't even take anything sef...
17/11/2019, 9:53 pm - Richie: Chaii.. Analyst biko am sorry time too
17/11/2019, 9:55 pm - +234 803 263 4711: Alright
Hope you enjoyed your day??
17/11/2019, 9:55 pm - Richie: Yes ohh

Fellow data scientist came to spice the event up @obinna 💪🏽
17/11/2019, 9:58 pm - Richie: Also its better to be yourself.. Its not every time you want to be thinking plenty... If you ordered Heineken it also could me you don't have a standard jx here to copy 💁🏽‍♂... So many things can be gotten but taking the drink is not the issues... Its what was discussed during the drinking process.... 😅
17/11/2019, 9:58 pm - +234 703 160 7868: Then you're perfectly in order. If you're a non alcohol drinker, no problem, just take your soft drink. At the end of the day you're still you.😎
17/11/2019, 10:00 pm - Richie: Me i will even engage him in why he took the drink instead of the other competing product jx to see his view.. I go ask questions tire ehnn.. So let him drink while i interview him..🤣
17/11/2019, 10:08 pm - +234 703 160 7868: Another angle. There are  several ways one could chose to analyze that scenario.The price of the drink is another one. 

In this case and given the location, I'm probably sure the price of just 🍺 Heinken = 🍻🍻 Trophy. So again, our guy here could be thought of as unknowingly picking quantity over quality.
17/11/2019, 10:09 pm - +234 903 210 6832: Mehnn oyinbo no get issues whalai

18/11/2019, 7:40 am - +234 805 444 1077: As a data analyst, what is the protocol that can be used to get estimate number of abokis shop in Lagos and Nigeria.. It was one of my interview questions and I was just parabulating without answers
18/11/2019, 7:43 am - +234 816 062 6971: This is an example of a guesstimating question. They don't really care about correctness. They want to see your thought process, how you approach it.
18/11/2019, 7:46 am - Opaino: Very correct 

No truer saying
18/11/2019, 7:46 am - Opaino: Same way I was asked what the number of match box that will fill up the interview room
18/11/2019, 7:46 am - Opaino: 😀😀
18/11/2019, 7:47 am - Opaino: They are test of your thought process not necessarily correctness
18/11/2019, 7:47 am - +234 816 062 6971: Mine was what is the weight of what in all the oceans and how many filling stations are in my state.

18/11/2019, 7:49 am - +234 816 170 8710: So what were your answers🙏🙏
18/11/2019, 7:51 am - Opaino: 1cm per box

 10ft room by my estimation

 12 inches make 1 ft

120 inches

 1 inch = 2.5cm

2.5 x 120

 300boxes
18/11/2019, 7:51 am - Opaino: My question and my approach
18/11/2019, 7:54 am - +234 816 062 6971: You could estimate the volume of the room and that of the matches then divide to get number of matches that can fit in
18/11/2019, 7:54 am - Opaino: Another angle
18/11/2019, 7:54 am - +234 816 170 8710: Exactly my thought
18/11/2019, 7:56 am - +234 805 444 1077: Hmmm
18/11/2019, 7:56 am - +234 805 444 1077: I think this are very common data analytics questions someone must know
18/11/2019, 7:56 am - Opaino: @2348054441077 not necessarily 

Truth me told data analytics Interview goes anyway
18/11/2019, 7:57 am - +234 805 444 1077: I told him for every street in Lagos, u will find at least 2 abokis, and then in a local govt we will get at least 500 streets and I went on and on sha
18/11/2019, 7:58 am - Opaino: Some want to test your understanding of Fundamental math, some Statistics, some core Data-science questions while some will just go along the line of your personal projects to understand your thought process behind the project
18/11/2019, 7:58 am - +234 805 444 1077: Hmmmm
18/11/2019, 7:59 am - Opaino: I had done an interview where the interviewer asked me why I did what I had done in my project and which another best practise would have been more effective.

Trust I was lost even in my own project
18/11/2019, 8:00 am - +234 805 444 1077: Chai
18/11/2019, 8:01 am - Obinna: You just get a Sample (maybe your L.G.A), perform descriptive statistics on your sample (in this case you determine number of Aboki shops in your L.G.A) and use your results to perform inference on your population (estimate number of Aboki shops in Lagos or Nigeria).
18/11/2019, 8:02 am - Obinna: You can then perform Z-tests to determine confidence interval
18/11/2019, 8:02 am - Opaino: Boss 😀😀🙌
18/11/2019, 8:03 am - Obinna: Cos it's practically infeasible to accurately determine number of Aboki shops in Nigeria 🤕
18/11/2019, 8:03 am - +234 816 062 6971: I could even come from the angle of number of local governments in Nigeria, distinguish between the mainland and Island because the number of Abokis will vary for different of areas. I could come from the angle of rough areas and areas that are like estates. I could consider average number of streets in those areas. For long streets - number of abokis could be between 2 to 4 and for short streets, 1 on the rough areas and so on
18/11/2019, 8:03 am - Obinna: Na you be my Oga o! I dey loyal.
18/11/2019, 8:05 am - Opaino: But that intuition was cool actually which shows an understanding of domain concept
18/11/2019, 8:06 am - Obinna: There'll always be errors in these kinds of analysis, that's why it's an estimation.
You just do your best to reduce the error to the barest minimum.
18/11/2019, 8:07 am - Opaino: Your estimation might be a bit tricky here
18/11/2019, 8:08 am - Obinna: Thanks Boss. We keep learning. There's so much to learn.
I even have an exam today🏃🏾🏃🏾
18/11/2019, 8:09 am - Opaino: Success man 💪
18/11/2019, 8:10 am - +234 816 062 6971: Maybe
But I feel those are some of the thoughts they want to see
I could make it more complex by considering some other factors too.
18/11/2019, 8:12 am - +234 816 062 6971: I understand you
We are not calculating real values.
I feel it's thought process they are concerned about

I'm here with another challenge o.

There might be some way on SQL. If you figure it out, do update us.

For 2) On SQL right?🤔

02/12/2019, 8:12 pm - Opaino: Hey guys 

An FMCG multinational company is in need of an experienced Data Analyst, so if you've got a track record of setting up a data structure for an organization coupled with an analytical skills of making sense out of data  your expertise is badly needed.

Please reach out to me ASAP so I can recommend you
02/12/2019, 8:19 pm - +234 816 398 2854: Great man🙇‍♂🙇‍♂🙇‍♂

02/12/2019, 8:52 pm - +234 816 381 5935: @2348108522573 .. comman help our life. So we can be applying for jobs like this now..😏😏
02/12/2019, 8:55 pm - Opaino: The Manager was specific about someone with an experience with working with either Multinationals or any company not just having the skills alone because I tried to pitch to him that I can recommend folks who will be a good job, but he explained that they need someone who has that Experience and can first help them set up and bring structure into their data then the need for other member of the team will come up later. So I really understand that some things can only be learnt via real life and no course can teach it
02/12/2019, 8:56 pm - +234 706 792 4252: @2348163815935 🙄🙄😊🙄🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
02/12/2019, 8:57 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Quite true man... Quite true..
02/12/2019, 8:57 pm - Olayinka DS: True
02/12/2019, 8:58 pm - Olayinka DS: Start somewhere.. Get the experience and move
02/12/2019, 8:58 pm - Opaino: 👌👌
02/12/2019, 8:58 pm - Olayinka DS: Many of us can do amazingly well but we are quite unsure of our capabilities because we have not had our hands dirty
02/12/2019, 8:59 pm - Opaino: Exactly
02/12/2019, 8:59 pm - +234 806 753 7522: You r right
02/12/2019, 8:59 pm - Olayinka DS: I think that we might not necessarily have to start at the top.. Or one big organization..
02/12/2019, 8:59 pm - Opaino: Managing stakeholders alone with your insights from your data alone need some Experience
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - Olayinka DS: This is what I am reading about in a book by Provost and Fawcett (Data Science for Business)
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Yes. I also agree with this
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - Opaino: There are times I will think I have build one mad model or make insights na so my boss go just sight loophole then my eyes get opened
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - Opaino: Best book
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - Richie: And its only people who have the skill that can now learn so it can become experience... People will only have skill set until they are given the opportunity to replicate in real life.. But employers are looking for people who are already vast witj real life.. Its jx too hard... @opino you self tell them some sense...if thats what day want people you have are only good in the skill from Online course.. If they are stuck jx like you were in your current work they will need to figure it out... Not every time experience experience.. How will someone get it with out working... They can conduct test an all sort of stuff to know the best candidate... My opinion sha..
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - Opaino: Every Data Scientist need to read that book
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - Olayinka DS: Very fundamental
02/12/2019, 9:00 pm - Olayinka DS: Gbam!
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - Opaino: It shift my focus that competitive Programming is different from real world
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Bookmarked...✍✍✍✍✍
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - Olayinka DS: And Elements of Statistical learning
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Hmmmm. @2348108522573 . More emphasis please.
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - +234 816 381 5935: That statement caught my attention.
02/12/2019, 9:01 pm - Olayinka DS: Yesso..
02/12/2019, 9:02 pm - Opaino: Xgboost and co win Competitions but trust me they are not applicable in real world
02/12/2019, 9:02 pm - Olayinka DS: <Media omitted>
02/12/2019, 9:02 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Wow... Really?..
02/12/2019, 9:03 pm - Opaino: Because they are not explainable and that's why stakeholders will prefer a simple logistic regression  or linear regression which is explanable can convince client
02/12/2019, 9:03 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Hmmmmmm...
02/12/2019, 9:04 pm - Opaino: I understand you actually but Experience will be needed for a company who just want to set up their data team.

I can tell you first hand
02/12/2019, 9:05 pm - Richie: True saying and am sure its because you are exposed 😊.. And before then, jx like many though xgboost but real life will probably be logistics Regression abi linear or ordinary decision tree....
02/12/2019, 9:05 pm - Richie: Sure i know... I get you perfectly.... 1 out of 5 people with such skill will be already employed
02/12/2019, 9:06 pm - Richie: Unless they want contract staff to set it up and build a team before leaving and you my friend should be a perfect fit😊
02/12/2019, 9:06 pm - Opaino: If you throw someone with just online course or Kaggle Competition with no business acumen into stakeholder management it's might be disaster and that's why an experienced person is first sought after to bring structure then those with skills will be recruited to join the team
02/12/2019, 9:07 pm - Opaino: So the advise will be for fresh folks trying to gain entry is to continue to hone skills to be ready when such roles opened up
02/12/2019, 9:08 pm - +234 816 381 5935: I also feel it's good to target all these startup companies that have a data science team already.
02/12/2019, 9:08 pm - Opaino: Exactly
02/12/2019, 9:08 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Such firms will give you a window to get and get your hands to work..
02/12/2019, 9:09 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Within few months.. you can then japa to all those multinationals them.
02/12/2019, 9:09 pm - Opaino: It might come with low pay but pay the sacrifice, so get the hands-on then you can move
02/12/2019, 9:10 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Quite true .. that's where I am headed to at the moment Sha. I always believe that as little as 6 months of hands-on experience in small firms is enough to land someone in a great DS position especially in Naija.
02/12/2019, 9:11 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Actually. I also believe that even with the emergence of the buzz word. All those that know their onions will definitely be fine last last. No be everybody were shout Data Science dey really do am woo😃😃
02/12/2019, 9:12 pm - Opaino: 🤣😀

The last sentence is true o
02/12/2019, 9:13 pm - Opaino: And that's the fear of many organization because many claim to be one because there is so much noise making it difficult to get those that are actually good
02/12/2019, 9:14 pm - Richie: True
02/12/2019, 9:14 pm - Opaino: And that's why my advise to guys is to separate yourself from the crowd as you hone your skills associate yourself with a community known
02/12/2019, 9:14 pm - Richie: Even in the US data science job differ from one another according to one kaggle webiner i attended..
02/12/2019, 9:14 pm - Opaino: That way recommendation will help out

02/12/2019, 10:21 pm - +234 802 825 9007: 6 months experience ain't enough
02/12/2019, 10:29 pm - +234 816 398 2854: Yes oo
02/12/2019, 10:29 pm - +234 815 344 5898: U neva sleep
03/12/2019, 7:59 am - +234 703 160 7868: This is nothing but the undiluted truth👌🏻. In the real world, a blend of both soft and hard skills is required even for a Data Scientis Most stakeholders in a big organization especially top mgt. wont tally to all your data jargons if it doesn't make business sense to them.
03/12/2019, 8:00 am - +234 703 160 7868: Awesome.Thanks for sharing this.

04/12/2019, 9:02 am - +234 806 513 1448: Especially as a beginner
04/12/2019, 9:03 am - +234 908 221 6060: One can still learn
04/12/2019, 9:03 am - +234 812 674 5707: Yes.
04/12/2019, 9:03 am - +234 908 221 6060: But as a software developer that's just like a little headstart🤔🤔
04/12/2019, 9:04 am - +234 812 674 5707: A lot of skills you already posses, such as writing clean code, using version control tools and the likes are transferable.
04/12/2019, 9:04 am - +234 812 674 5707: Logging and documentation etc..
04/12/2019, 9:04 am - +234 806 513 1448: Ok
04/12/2019, 9:04 am - +234 806 513 1448: Ok. Thanks. I was just wondering

04/12/2019, 10:42 am - Opaino: @2348028259007 


Can you please help out from your experience as a Data-scientist who is currently working as a Software engineer, I believe a first hand opinion from you will help out aside the general opinion
04/12/2019, 10:44 am - +234 802 825 9007: Yes it's very major as you learn to write efficient and optimised programs. Makes you understand a lot of intricate parts of computer programming

Kind of stuck, it's my first time using the tool so need help.
04/12/2019, 1:22 pm - +234 706 936 1298: What's the issue
04/12/2019, 1:24 pm - +234 806 513 1448: Microsoft LEAP posted earlier
04/12/2019, 1:24 pm - +234 812 202 5113: Have u applied ?
04/12/2019, 1:24 pm - +234 806 513 1448: Conventional banking is dying. It's time to move into something else
04/12/2019, 1:25 pm - +234 806 513 1448: No. I don't think I can move to Lagos now
04/12/2019, 1:25 pm - +234 812 202 5113: Yea
04/12/2019, 1:26 pm - Opaino: Trying to load a data into SqL server using SSIS for data integrity check and all from a server, but the connection flow keep returning error 


"Global access memory isn't available"
04/12/2019, 1:27 pm - Opaino: I've tried and read stuffs online but no headway  or do you have a good resource to quickly learn SSIS on a deep level maybe that might help to debug the error
04/12/2019, 1:36 pm - +27 82 780 8535: SSIS is a glorified version of the tool above, to master it you still need to master SQL Server select like commands first
04/12/2019, 1:37 pm - +27 82 780 8535: <Media omitted>
04/12/2019, 2:26 pm - +234 706 936 1298: Not a frequent error in SSIS, you probably are using a recent version of SQL server data tool
04/12/2019, 2:47 pm - +234 706 936 1298: I will push some materials to you

You just gotta be prepared to learn the 1001 JavaScript frameworks
08/12/2019, 8:56 am - +27 82 780 8535: Then in addition to JavaScript either basic C# or php quite useful, oh there's also json to master which is more or less JavaScript anyway

08/12/2019, 9:53 am - +27 82 780 8535: It's both, JavaScript has evolved as a technology where it has backend and front end variants now

*Me:* Hello! Is this Gordon's Pizza?

*Autobot:* No sir, it's Google's Pizza.

*Me:* Did I dial the wrong number?

*Autobot:* No sir, Google bought the pizza store.

*Me:* Oh, alright - then I’d like to place an order please.

*Autobot:* Okay sir, do you want the usual?

*Me:* The usual? You know what my usual is?

*Autobot:* According to the caller ID, the last 15 times you’ve ordered a 12-slice with double-cheese, sausage, and thick crust.

*Me:* Okay - that’s what I want this time too.

*Autobot:* May I suggest that this time you order an 8-slice with ricotta, arugula, and tomato instead?

*Me:* No, I hate vegetables.

*Autobot:* But your cholesterol is not good
.
*Me:* How do you know?

*Autobot:* Through the subscribers guide. We have the results of your blood tests for the last 7 years.

*Me:* Maybe so, but I don’t want the pizza you suggest – I already take medicine for high cholesterol.

*Autobot:* But you haven’t taken the medicine regularly. 4 months ago you purchased from Drugsale Network a box of only 30 tablets.

*Me:* I bought more from another drugstore.

*Autobot:* It's not showing on your credit card sir.

*Me:* I paid in cash.

*Autobot:* But according to your bank statement you did not withdraw that much cash.

*Me:* I have another source of cash.

*Autobot:* This is not showing on your last tax form, unless you got it from an undeclared income source.

*Me:* WHAT THE HELL? ENOUGH! I'm sick of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. I'm going to an island without internet, where there’s no cellphone line, and no one to spy on me ...

*Autobot:* I understand sir, but you’ll need to renew your passport ... it expired 5 weeks ago.

14/12/2019, 11:46 am - Olayinka DS: Hey friends. I have a situation at hand.
I have been clamoring for proper data structure for my church (am a Celestian).

We usually hold an annual retreat that lots of people attend yearly.

I suggested that a Data team should be created to cater for data collection up to analysis and making projections.

Now, I have been granted opportunity to set up a Data team to test run things..

Please suggest what we need?
14/12/2019, 11:47 am - Olayinka DS: I appreciate your suggestions please..

What do we need to do?
How can we gather data?
14/12/2019, 12:59 pm - +234 816 398 2854: ...
14/12/2019, 3:28 pm - +234 806 636 5554: Abraham please DM me..I lost my contacts.
Thanks
14/12/2019, 3:32 pm - +234 816 381 5935: Alright sir.
14/12/2019, 4:01 pm - +234 703 034 3362: Data you needs is depending on the objective you have in mind for setting up the data team..... Are you looking at gender ratio population, are you looking at arrival rate or how people usually turnout for the event in order to cater for their needs in term of food and many other logistics, if parking is the issues, then are you planning to project for the next year event by making necessary amenities available..... So my point is that your objective will create your data collection procedures and how you will get them
14/12/2019, 5:24 pm - +234 806 661 0922: I just saw this sir.thank you so much
14/12/2019, 5:27 pm - +234 703 160 7868: Just as someone already mentioned, it depends on the objective.

You have to first of all set an objective. Then the next question that suffices;

- What's the goal of the whole exercise? Do you intend to make use of the Data for anything specific?

When you've answered the above questions. Then next that will come in handy is a Data Strategy; Do you have one? What tools would be required to collect the data you need? 

Which of these is more central to the entire project?

•Data Collection
•Data Mining
•Data Analysis & Usage.

After you've answered the above, then you'd have figured out what you need to do next.
14/12/2019, 6:13 pm - Opaino: Spot on bro
14/12/2019, 6:14 pm - Opaino: 👌
14/12/2019, 6:16 pm - Opaino: Without repeating what everyone has said which is exactly what I will say base on my experience. So determine what you want to achieve then work backward because that will help you determine what kind of tools you need and also the kind of data you should collect.
14/12/2019, 8:18 pm - Olayinka DS: Thank you so much everyone.
For now the issue is data collection

My question is how can you get an estimate of people in convention where they done register to attend?
14/12/2019, 8:18 pm - Olayinka DS: Any suggestions?
14/12/2019, 8:19 pm - +234 815 308 9036: Where they don't register?

I'm assuming you don't have past data.
14/12/2019, 8:19 pm - Olayinka DS: Of course the Data would be used to project for next year program
14/12/2019, 8:19 pm - Olayinka DS: No past data
14/12/2019, 8:20 pm - Olayinka DS: No structure in place before now..
And we have like 6 days to the program..

Of course from next year, we can put up a better plan in place
14/12/2019, 8:21 pm - Olayinka DS: But they just want us to get an estimate of people that attends this year's program
14/12/2019, 8:21 pm - Olayinka DS: I appreciate anyone with ideas on how to get the estimate of a large crowd of people (like counting)
14/12/2019, 8:24 pm - +234 815 308 9036: You need some sort of reference point.

Whether it's number of people in the church or that come for midweek services or something since past data isn't there.
14/12/2019, 8:24 pm - +234 815 308 9036: What data can you actually get your hands on?
14/12/2019, 8:25 pm - +234 807 669 1530: Create a link to a form that they can assess online. Then compel them to register with that link. That might be a way to go about it.
14/12/2019, 8:30 pm - Olayinka DS: I can lay my hands on youths that attends the youth conference
14/12/2019, 8:30 pm - Olayinka DS: A projection for next year
14/12/2019, 8:37 pm - +27 61 290 0591: ✅💯. I would recommend Google Form
15/12/2019, 7:03 am - +234 703 160 7868: I'm guessing the assumption here is that they're all online/mobile savvy and they'll have access to a smart or mobile phone or device of some sort. But in this type of gatherings, expect a lot of people to barely even own regular phones not to talk of smartphones.

So there'll be issues with dealing with tons people like this.
15/12/2019, 7:20 am - +234 703 160 7868: Your best bet right now is to do it through the painstaking route by using the manual  (Indian) counting method. 


1. Based on past attendance projections, create a simple data capture form and print them out in large copies.

2. Get some of the youths you can talk to and put them to the task. For example, if previous attendance figures were estimated to be 1000 people including men, women and children.

3. Organize your youths into 10 point areas for data collection with tables and chairs. This is with the projection that at least each youth should be able to capture at least a 100 persons per point.

4. You can organize the points to capture only specific genders i.e 5 points each for both men and women. 

5. Then have at least 3 extra persons (youth) who will input the manual data entry on your church's data collection system in simple excel format.

6. It'll be a tedious operation, but at the end. You'll have accomplished what you wanted.

7. Lastly, get the chutch leadership to incentivize  this for everyone to comply. The reason is that just few people (Church or not) are willing to give out their basic information or data.
15/12/2019, 8:09 am - Olayinka DS: Hmm
15/12/2019, 8:10 am - Richie: You guys are correct but i think what he is asking for is a way to get a sample mean
15/12/2019, 8:18 am - Richie: Sorry a sample size not mean
15/12/2019, 7:15 pm - Opaino: Evening guys 

Happy Sunday to you all
15/12/2019, 7:17 pm - Opaino: I'm developing my new learning road map focus on "Data Viz & Deep Learning " , so I need a study partner for vibe.

Anyone in please signify let's come up with something.

Thanks
15/12/2019, 7:20 pm - +27 82 780 8535: What are you doing on the visualization bit?

15/12/2019, 7:31 pm - Opaino: More into BI Developer role not just reporting ish
15/12/2019, 7:32 pm - +27 82 780 8535: as in DAX and stuff? then am interested, Deep Learning, am interested in the maths behind it but most people are not they think it's too hard
15/12/2019, 7:32 pm - Opaino: The color kinda too noisy actually🙈

DAX not far-fetched from SQL scripting
15/12/2019, 7:32 pm - Opaino: That's what I want to focus on
15/12/2019, 7:33 pm - +27 82 780 8535: haven't themed it yet, so not really bothered with colours
15/12/2019, 7:33 pm - +234 802 755 7589: We should complement, I have relatively good skill in Power BI and Tableau, but trying to perfect SQL.
15/12/2019, 7:33 pm - Opaino: DAX & M language of PowerBI jf you master it you become a mad Developer
15/12/2019, 7:34 pm - Opaino: Most people run from it actually
15/12/2019, 7:34 pm - +27 82 780 8535: i can imagine, looks like fun to me
15/12/2019, 7:34 pm - Opaino: It's kinda involve some scripting and understand what's happening under the hood
15/12/2019, 7:35 pm - +27 82 780 8535: SQL is the easy bit for me
15/12/2019, 7:35 pm - +27 82 780 8535: talk is cheap, how do we concretely make this happen, that's the question ?
15/12/2019, 7:36 pm - Opaino: Let's team up 

I want to dedicate 2 month to demystify it 

A colleague of mine showed me a mad visual he did at work with some mad automation linking it into SQL server
15/12/2019, 7:37 pm - Opaino: I've got some books a colleague shared with me , so it's going to be project based
15/12/2019, 7:38 pm - +27 82 780 8535: books and material not an issue , have tons of videos and books, time to use them the challenge but i do what i can
15/12/2019, 7:39 pm - Opaino: You can't perfect SQL😀, it's too complex so just learn it to do basic stuff then when the need arises you will learn the advanced one
15/12/2019, 8:38 pm - +234 703 034 3362: This is just it
16/12/2019, 8:18 am - +234 806 513 1448: Hello everyone

16/12/2019, 8:16 pm - +234 703 034 3362: Nice one, get more dirty with data, and get clean up with insight
16/12/2019, 8:17 pm - +27 82 780 8535: my first takeaway would serie A percentage for 3 goal matches, casually i see them as a lower scoring league, therefore I expected higher percentages for 2 goal and 1 goal matches
16/12/2019, 8:18 pm - +27 82 780 8535: I haven't updated this data to this season, that will be my next task
16/12/2019, 8:20 pm - +27 61 290 0591: I would suggest that you remove "Championship" and replace it with "League 1"
16/12/2019, 8:20 pm - +27 82 780 8535: it is called the championship in England 🤔?
16/12/2019, 8:21 pm - +27 82 780 8535: and the French league called League 1
16/12/2019, 8:23 pm - +27 61 290 0591: I know. Championship is a second division league. I would be more to do your analysis across Europe's top 5 league
16/12/2019, 8:27 pm - +27 82 780 8535: i have no particular reason to focus only on the top 5 European leagues and part of the reason I have included the Championship is because their data is quite comprehensive say compared to Serie A and the fact that in England there's more teams that got relegated to  the Championship so that would minimize gaps in club data
16/12/2019, 8:56 pm - +27 61 290 0591: I do get your point. However, I feel it should be a case of comparing "Eggs with Eggs".
16/12/2019, 8:58 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Nah, am comfortable with the approach am taking at the moment, i also need to be able to filter this by club and 1st and 2nd half, plenty of work going forward 👍🏾
16/12/2019, 8:59 pm - +27 61 290 0591: 👍🏾
16/12/2019, 9:03 pm - +234 905 746 8437: Nice one 👍🏼👍🏼
16/12/2019, 9:04 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Also, if there's a visualization you'd like you see let me know, as that would be the best way for me to practice

19/12/2019, 3:10 pm - Opaino: And be a jack of all and master of known
19/12/2019, 3:11 pm - Opaino: That's why there are area of specializations for you to choose and interest and be very good at it, so choosing a focus isn't consoling oneself
19/12/2019, 3:12 pm - Opaino: Btw some of the skills also add up over the years base on experience of working on various real life project

19/12/2019, 4:20 pm - Olayinka DS: Gbam!
19/12/2019, 5:26 pm - Obinna: Then why do we have Data science teams?

You can specialize in some areas, have idea about others but you can't know everything. Plus new ideas come out everyday, you still need to stay up-to-date in your area of specialization.
19/12/2019, 5:26 pm - Obinna: Facts
19/12/2019, 5:29 pm - Obinna: This is the reason why people will do Python for 1 month, R the next month, Spark the next month and so on.

Next thing they'll come posing with certifications. One deep question in any of the areas they'll start fumbling.
19/12/2019, 5:32 pm - Richie: 🍻.... Even Geoffrey Hinton is *jx* the godfather of Netural network and baba sabi say specialization breed invention

19/12/2019, 5:50 pm - Opaino: One thing I have come realize during the little time working is learn the basics and general overview, develop depth in an area then as project emerges you will learn some stuffs which will increase your skill stack
19/12/2019, 5:50 pm - +234 907 057 5162: Yh this is what I was trying to pass.

27/12/2019, 2:08 pm - Opaino: There are lot of databases out there from Postresql to SQL Server to MySQL to Oracle Database.

All have their varying differences when it come to data Engineering, but there is a standard query syntax that is common to them all which i will say you should learn.

My current role makes me learn SQL Server which wasn't difficult diving since I knew the standard SQL for all.

28/12/2019, 8:23 am - Opaino: For courses on Coursera I stated on the link, kindly be informed that you can apply for financial aid for all Coursera courses to take it for free without paying.
28/12/2019, 8:25 am - +234 814 830 9097: Alright, thank you.
28/12/2019, 8:26 am - Opaino: https://learn.21cskills.africa


Here you go

I will drop how to sequence to choose each course
28/12/2019, 8:27 am - Muhammed Analyst: For the benefit of those who will be applying for the financial aid, I'll be dropping the guide here
28/12/2019, 8:27 am - Muhammed Analyst: Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid? 

I am a student from Nigeria and want to learn Version Control with Git. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Version Control with Git and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge. This course will help me in defining Version Control with Git, understanding how Version Control with Git could potentially impact our business and industry, to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Git, explain Version Control with Git to clients, friends, joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak. Identifying which aspects of Version Control with Git seem most important and relevant to us, Walking away with a strong foundation in where Git is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Version Control with Git course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past

Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.

The simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.
28/12/2019, 8:27 am - Opaino: Thanks @2348108316393 🤭

28/12/2019, 8:28 am - Muhammed Analyst: All you need to do is edit the course name. In this instance, the course I applied for is *Git Control*.

28/12/2019, 8:30 am - +234 817 196 7682: At the end of the course (after using financial aid), will they issue certificate of completion?
28/12/2019, 8:30 am - Obinna: Yea, sure
28/12/2019, 8:30 am - Opaino: For some it will be good to take both of them eg 

2. Excel & PowerBI  - I can tell you from experience no matter how good you are in other analytical tool you cant afford to neglect *Excel* because there are some Analysis you will do using python or other will be waste of time when you can use simple "Index match" in Excel to do it.
28/12/2019, 8:31 am - +234 817 196 7682: Wow!

Let's move✈

28/12/2019, 8:32 am - Opaino: Microsoft is retiring the program which mean Certification will not be available because they are upgrading the program, however the courses are still available

28/12/2019, 8:34 am - +234 705 579 9202: Would we get certification at the end ?
And is this part of the Google programme that expires on the 31st of this year?
28/12/2019, 8:34 am - +234 808 325 6441: Ohh I see
28/12/2019, 8:35 am - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
28/12/2019, 8:36 am - Opaino: No Certification because it will be retired 31/12/2019


I can tell you beyond the Certification the knowledge is what is key and important
28/12/2019, 8:36 am - +234 808 289 6892: Does anyone know how to data scrap?
28/12/2019, 8:36 am - Opaino: On web?

To learn from top notch data scientists ans Artificial Intelligence expert
28/12/2019, 10:09 am - Obinna: I go try. Don't have access to my laptop till tomorrow evening.
But the main thing is the knowledge. Certification is just a plus.

28/12/2019, 10:14 am - +234 816 000 5595: Thanks admin for this creativity...I want to ask...microsoft learn courses and this 21cskills courses are they the same

28/12/2019, 10:15 am - +234 814 830 9097: Oh niceee...

Have you done the subscription perhaps?
28/12/2019, 10:15 am - Opaino: Yes.

21cskills is a platform that all Microsoft courses and other courses
28/12/2019, 10:15 am - Obinna: I think I enrolled in the program but yet to complete. I'm chilling this holiday man don too work.
I might complete the program later but I've done similar courses somewhere else.
28/12/2019, 10:15 am - +234 806 290 9976: ....
28/12/2019, 10:17 am - +234 814 830 9097: And guys, I'm having a little issue along my learning process and I'd like to know if it's just me or that's how it's.

When learning, most times, I understand the concepts and all but as you all know it can be overwhelming sometimes. So I end up forgetting some syntax, methods and all...
And I find the documentation quite cumbersome so I always have a little difficulty checking up methods and other syntax...

Is this normal please?
28/12/2019, 10:17 am - Muhammed Analyst: Not sure, Microsoft Learn has two categories;

1. Free but not detailed online training (you only pay for the certification exam) which is $80

2. Paid and fully detailed courses which are same as 21cskills (I don't have an idea of what it costs)
28/12/2019, 10:17 am - +234 703 365 7422: Is it free
28/12/2019, 10:17 am - Opaino: Yeah

Thanks
28/12/2019, 10:17 am - Opaino: Yop
28/12/2019, 10:17 am - Obinna: Please Fam, let's not be entirely focused on certificates but in actually understanding whatever course we take.

It's highly advisable we also work on projects to put these skills to practice.
28/12/2019, 10:19 am - Opaino: Normal 😄

You are not expected to cram syntax actually. I only remember syntax I use frequently then use Google for the ones I can't remember and I need to use.

So it's normal just understand what each method does and when to use it
28/12/2019, 10:19 am - Opaino: Spot on


Certificate is the last thing actually.
28/12/2019, 10:19 am - +234 814 830 9097: Alright, 😊
Thank you very much.
28/12/2019, 10:19 am - +234 814 830 9097: Noted.

28/12/2019, 10:21 am - +234 813 747 4240: It’s normal, you will forget syntax if you don’t use them regularly but the thing is you know and understand functionalities, when you approach a problem you will recall a concept to tackle the problem then google the right syntax.
Even professionals still find googling handy
28/12/2019, 10:21 am - Richie: 💪🏽

28/12/2019, 10:24 am - +27 82 780 8535: ppl quite focused on wanting to learn deep learning or any other fancy data science methodology but i hardly hear anyone talking about data they are working on and what they want to get out of that data using these methodologies, i would like to think there's a reason the group is called Young Data Professionals but at the moment it's better off being called Young Data *Certifications* Professionals
28/12/2019, 10:24 am - Muhammed Analyst: Github repos are the there to guide you and provide you with sufficient practice data and files
28/12/2019, 10:29 am - +234 814 830 9097: Oh, interesting. 
Thanksssss
28/12/2019, 10:31 am - +234 814 830 9097: That's because some of us are still so new to the field we can't even venture into Deep learning or ML yet. We need to extensively prepare ourself. 
But that's the idea, you can ask anything about analytics, I'm sure someone on the same track with you with respond or better still it could serve to mentally stimulate us. 😊
28/12/2019, 10:32 am - +234 814 830 9097: Alright
28/12/2019, 10:32 am - Opaino: @27827808535 the group comprises of folks across boards ranging from those who have honed the skills and just need projects to those just starting out.

So I believe your concern will be targeted to the former. My next year will be focused more on personal projects so definitely will hint us of what I'm doing maybe I can get team mate😉

Thanks for the concern which is valid
28/12/2019, 10:33 am - +234 816 000 5595: Will applying for financial aid put one on a detailed  courses or not detailed online training?

28/12/2019, 10:40 am - +234 806 058 7948: Please can someone explain to me how I can apply for financial aid on coursera?
And will it be fully paid?
28/12/2019, 10:41 am - +27 82 780 8535: the speed of this industry makes that a luxury and going back to data, everything start with the very simple methods so more of that as well

28/12/2019, 1:23 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
28/12/2019, 1:24 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Let's all be creative, this is but a guide towards the application process.
28/12/2019, 1:24 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid? 

I am a student from Nigeria and want to learn Version Control with Git. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Version Control with Git and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge. This course will help me in defining Version Control with Git, understanding how Version Control with Git could potentially impact our business and industry, to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Git, explain Version Control with Git to clients, friends, joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak. Identifying which aspects of Version Control with Git seem most important and relevant to us, Walking away with a strong foundation in where Git is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Version Control with Git course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past

Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.

The simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.

28/12/2019, 1:53 pm - +234 909 778 5164: Quick question. Do you have to apply for financial aid for every course? Or once u've applied once, it covers all
28/12/2019, 1:53 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Currently, I'm learning python for Data Science using Data quest already, and it's been amazing. Although, I have to support with YouTube to understand some things
28/12/2019, 1:55 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Each course
28/12/2019, 1:56 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Dataquest is also a good platform for learning just like *Data Camp*, *IBM Digital Nation*, *Cognitive Classes* etc.

28/12/2019, 2:22 pm - +234 809 479 3406: While it's good to learn python, SQL, R etc at a go, I prefer to *master* python, and Excel first before learning other languages.

Who else feels this way? Is this even the right way?

28/12/2019, 2:44 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Data science is combination of programming (databases and algorithm) , statistics and some applied maths

Then there's a number of specializations within data science, like image recognition, prediction, classification to name a few

Hence it becomes important to focus on a small data science problem at the beginning, weed out the other stuff till you get comfortable enough with the problem u r trying to solve

Also depending on what you want to do with the it also research on job availability in your field of interest

Languages are essentially a tool, a good data scientist shouldn't struggle too much with switching between languages but of course python is the main programming language but some data scientists don't even use python they use excel, knime, spss and a lot of other tools.

In a nutshell, focus is key at the beginning
28/12/2019, 2:52 pm - +234 808 339 2756: I think is better we move to Telegram to accommodate more people

28/12/2019, 2:58 pm - Opaino: Just like @27827808535  as stated your area of interest will determine the tool to learn, however for an Analyst role I will recommend;

Excel >> PowerBI >> SQL >> Python (for advanced stuff) which you give you a +
28/12/2019, 2:58 pm - Opaino: Thanks @27827808535  for this

28/12/2019, 3:05 pm - +27 82 780 8535: Also if, one wants to solve deep problems in data science *linear algebra and multivariate calculus* are a must.
Of course there are libraries in most scientific programming languages that take care of the details but that's not enough for the really complicated problems
28/12/2019, 3:09 pm - Opaino: Surety

There is a good course on "Mathematics for Machine Learning" on Coursera and I heard it really a good course in demystifying all the maths needed for DL &ML.
28/12/2019, 3:10 pm - Opaino: Understanding the math behind ML concepts help your intuition and gaining grasp of what's happening under the hood to help your debugging when error arises
28/12/2019, 3:10 pm - +234 808 325 6441: I’m presently taking the course and submitting the programming assignment can be a great headache
28/12/2019, 3:10 pm - Opaino: Wow

How is the course?
28/12/2019, 3:11 pm - +234 808 325 6441: It’s very good at least it refreshes your memory
28/12/2019, 3:11 pm - Opaino: I should take it when I'm free sha which I don't know when 😄 because all the projects piled up for my current role isn't DL targeted.
28/12/2019, 3:11 pm - Opaino: Ooh, cool then.
28/12/2019, 3:14 pm - +27 82 780 8535: With linear algebra, mastering *eigendecomposition and single value decomposition* is a must, and that is 2nd year level university linear algebra therefore those have their prerequisited
28/12/2019, 3:16 pm - +27 82 780 8535: *Recommendation engines* like the one you see on Amazon are based on *single value decomposition svd*

I will find a way to download and move to azure storage cloud.
29/12/2019, 4:05 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Then share the link to download with you guys.

Google drive is 15 gig free.
I have azure subscription that I can use to get as many storage space as I want but I don't know how to set the process up unlike Google drive.

If anyone here knows how to set up azure storage pls put me through

Then in the storage account, create a file share service. 

With the file share link shared, anyone can map the drive to their local PC and download the files. 

It's a very simple and easy process. I will share link on how to create storage and file share then simple way for anyone to map it on their PC for download

29/12/2019, 4:36 pm - +234 909 681 6401: 10 Commandments of Data Science

1. Focus primarily on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

2. Data will never be clean or easily available. Data gathering and cleaning will take 80% of your time and efforts.

3. Don’t underestimate the power of Excel and SQL - they are still two of the most useful tools for data analysis.

4. Simple models such as Linear or Logistics Regression will be good enough for the majority of the problems. You don’t need neural networks to solve every problem.

5. Textbook solutions will not work for most of the practical problems. You will need to try new approaches and innovate as required.

6. Nobody can remember everything. On the job, you can always use Google, Stack Overflow etc.

7. Learn Data Visualisation and develop the ability to explain your key insights in simple terms - these skills will be very useful with non-technical and business stakeholders.

8. Learn PowerPoint and storytelling - people may not appreciate your great work if you can’t convince them with your communication.

9. Data Science field is evolving rapidly. Please learn continuously, else you might become obsolete soon.

10. Focus primarily on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

Happy Sunday to you
29/12/2019, 6:38 pm - +234 708 531 6273: If you don't mind, let me give my piece on behalf of ope.
1. Brush over Python.Since you are coming from software development , you wouldn't have any problem getting started with python.

2. Brush your basic statistics knowledge. Start from the basics. Understand Distributions , Probability and Regression. You don't need to know the whole college statistics to get started . Understand what is happening under the hood, Scikit(a library in python) learn will do the heavy lifting for you.

3. learn the rest by doing. start working on projects. For every challenge you face check a cookbook for way out. For example, let's say you want to know the mean of age variable(column) in your dataset just go to your cookbook and check how to do that. You don't have to spend months learning Pandas (a python library used to work on tables).
Same thing for numpy and other host of libraries. I feel this this the mistake newbies make. Spending months on python, months on Numpy, months on Pandas, and at the end of the day they won't know how to tie it together for real world application.

29/12/2019, 6:41 pm - Opaino: To all complete novice in here don't get overwhelmed by all the resources here and there, I believe you must have gone through the Google drive article I shared so start with the 1st course there by PwC, it will stir your interest and prepare your mind on what the journey look like and you also get to learn Excel well

29/12/2019, 7:19 pm - +234 809 337 3463: Really
29/12/2019, 7:40 pm - Opaino: With your background in tech around you can be a Full stack AI Engineer as Andrew NG calls it in his report, so don't bother yourself about PowerBI or Analytics terrain just go and revamp your python well as @2347085316273  as explained.

Go deep into Deep Learning and let your algorithm, data structures skills come into play of deployment
29/12/2019, 7:42 pm - +234 708 531 6273: It is for all.
It covers the basics first before advanced concepts.
29/12/2019, 7:43 pm - Opaino: Only strong and few  people are in this terrain, so shoot for it your background gives you advantage already
29/12/2019, 7:44 pm - Opaino: https://www.freetutorialsus.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/

Start with this then after completion reach out to me on next move
29/12/2019, 7:48 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Well for certification, I think Ope will be in a better position to address this. I am not the certification kind of person. Though I have completed different courses on EDX, Datacamp ,Udemy, and Pluralsight. I am more interested in winning Data science competitions and building my project portfolio.

29/12/2019, 7:49 pm - Opaino: Me ke😄😄
29/12/2019, 7:51 pm - Opaino: Certification should be side gist and not the main. In this field from my discussion with experts and my boss who is a PhD holder in Computer Vision (You know what that mean😄😄) it's more targeted into your research, personal projects and work done to showcase your skills
29/12/2019, 7:52 pm - Opaino: So in essence don't let Certification be the major but honing the skills though you can get Certificate by the side for branding
29/12/2019, 7:54 pm - +234 908 219 5593: Evening group I'm a newbie here, for the udemy python course do I have to download all before signing out or I can just sign out and sign in later? Please this is my first course.
29/12/2019, 7:55 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Nice one. 
The truth is I don't finish courses Lol. Once I learn concepts I need to learn, I don't bother about practice questions. I just zoom off to zindi to apply.
29/12/2019, 7:56 pm - Opaino: Try and finish sha 😌😌

1. Data science is for anyone 

2. As you start learning, build a portfolio for yourself but most importantly START PREPARING FOR DATA INTERVIEWS
30/12/2019, 8:31 am - Opaino: Data related interviews aren't "Behavioral Interviews" of "Tell me a time you handled pressure o" 😄 even for an entry role
30/12/2019, 8:37 am - +234 909 617 2330: Morning guys
30/12/2019, 8:37 am - +234 909 617 2330: Please what application software is best/good for creating and managing SQL databases?

Please I'm having issues running my codes in Visual studio, any other of running codes asides using terminal?
30/12/2019, 8:40 am - Opaino: There is no best because it's base on your interest and application
30/12/2019, 8:40 am - Opaino: There is SQLite, Postresql, SQL server, MySQL etc
30/12/2019, 8:41 am - Opaino: SQLite & Postresql are easy to download and access the former are more Organization based and may be difficult to download
30/12/2019, 8:42 am - +234 909 617 2330: Okay. Postgresql uses the PGadmin interface right?
30/12/2019, 8:43 am - Opaino: Yeah
30/12/2019, 8:43 am - +234 909 617 2330: Because I just learnt database querying and I just got it installed but I haven't been able to get a hang of using the software
30/12/2019, 8:43 am - +234 909 617 2330: Oh okay
30/12/2019, 8:43 am - +234 909 617 2330: Thank you

Compliments of the season.
A retweet from you would go a long way in helping me secure a very important scholarship.

Here's it:

Kindly retweet and share.
30/12/2019, 12:09 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Hello everyone... Good day!

Could anyone explain the reason for this difference??

A.

for i in range(2,8):
    Ade=i*I
    print(Ade)

&


B. 

for i in range(2,8):
    Ade=i*I
print(Ade)



output of code A is 49 and is confusing me.

I do understand and agree with the output of code B which is:
4
9
16
25
36
49

Thanks


Observe the difference in indentation
30/12/2019, 12:11 pm - +234 816 342 0137: What's the value of l
30/12/2019, 12:12 pm - +234 816 000 5595: The output should even b for A not B
30/12/2019, 12:12 pm - +234 816 342 0137: For A, it's going to print the multiple of values in range i with L since the print function is part of the block
30/12/2019, 12:12 pm - +234 816 342 0137: Exactly
30/12/2019, 12:13 pm - +234 816 000 5595: He meant i * i
30/12/2019, 12:14 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Ade=i*i
30/12/2019, 12:14 pm - +234 808 882 4940: None


just like I was trying to multiply all elements found in that range of numbers....
30/12/2019, 12:14 pm - +234 816 342 0137: For B, its not working with the loop... maybe you've assigned some values to variable Ade and then you're printing
30/12/2019, 12:14 pm - +234 816 342 0137: Sure I got you now
30/12/2019, 12:14 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Show us the complete package
30/12/2019, 12:15 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Confusion Matrix🙆‍♂🙄
30/12/2019, 12:15 pm - +234 808 882 4940: yes i*i
30/12/2019, 12:15 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Autocorrect, thanks
30/12/2019, 12:15 pm - +234 816 000 5595: B will be 49 because the last loop is 7*7
30/12/2019, 12:16 pm - +234 816 170 8710: I think the B part where you print is not in the for look judging by the indentation.  Probably you have declare variable Ade outside the for loop
30/12/2019, 12:16 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Remember 8 will be exclusive in the loop and the print is not in the loop
30/12/2019, 12:16 pm - +234 816 170 8710: 👍
30/12/2019, 12:16 pm - +234 808 882 4940: No, but let me check again
30/12/2019, 12:17 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Yes, I do know that
30/12/2019, 12:17 pm - +234 808 882 4940: does it mean, it just pick *end minus1* and printed? and why?
30/12/2019, 12:18 pm - +234 816 000 5595: So the last variable for Ade will be 7*7
30/12/2019, 12:18 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Nop...what we have in the loop is 2,3,4,5,6,7
30/12/2019, 12:18 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Why does it have to be like that
30/12/2019, 12:18 pm - +234 808 882 4940: as in, why printing only 7
30/12/2019, 12:19 pm - +234 816 000 5595: In for loop, the last end will be exclusive
30/12/2019, 12:19 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Because indexing starts from 0
30/12/2019, 12:19 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Yes
30/12/2019, 12:19 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Yes
30/12/2019, 12:20 pm - +234 816 000 5595: If u say print 1,2,3,4,5
30/12/2019, 12:20 pm - +234 816 000 5595: 1=0
30/12/2019, 12:20 pm - +234 816 000 5595: 2= 1
30/12/2019, 12:20 pm - +234 816 000 5595: 3=2
4=3
5=4
30/12/2019, 12:22 pm - +234 816 342 0137: 👍
30/12/2019, 12:22 pm - +234 816 000 5595: The syntax should be

For x in (start, end-1)
30/12/2019, 12:23 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Yes, I understand the syntax
30/12/2019, 12:23 pm - +234 816 000 5595: 👍
30/12/2019, 12:29 pm - +234 808 882 4940: I understood code A not B
30/12/2019, 12:29 pm - +234 808 882 4940: I have seen my typo
30/12/2019, 12:31 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Yes, print not in the loop
30/12/2019, 12:36 pm - +234 808 882 4940: I am pretty glad with a your responses!🤗
30/12/2019, 12:36 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Thankz to everyone!

30/12/2019, 1:09 pm - +234 809 479 3406: ☝🏾
30/12/2019, 1:09 pm - +234 809 479 3406: ☝🏾
30/12/2019, 1:13 pm - +234 816 170 8710: That's one of the purpose of the group 👍
30/12/2019, 1:17 pm - Opaino: Theoretical based questions of data analytics/science concept

Role specific, so if it's a DS/ML related role then theories behind concepts and algorithm are emphasized, for Analyst role a refresher on basic statistics
30/12/2019, 1:17 pm - Opaino: I have answered this many times on this page😌

30/12/2019, 1:34 pm - +234 808 882 4940: I also 🏃 this code:👇

sol = 0
for i in numbers:
    sol = i*i
    print(sol)
30/12/2019, 1:35 pm - +234 808 882 4940: The answer is the same as that of this (that was inside the loop)
30/12/2019, 1:35 pm - +234 808 882 4940: for i in range(2,8):
    Ade=i*I
    print(Ade)
30/12/2019, 1:35 pm - +234 808 882 4940: This gives exactly same output
30/12/2019, 1:36 pm - +234 808 882 4940: ... as this

30/12/2019, 5:44 pm - +234 816 000 5595: I don't know how the data u are working with look like but if u want to gt the average rating I think you shud try  

Avg_rating = sum(all_rating)/Len(all_rating)
30/12/2019, 5:49 pm - +234 809 479 3406: That was what I did
30/12/2019, 5:49 pm - +234 809 479 3406: The error is coming from the fact that I converted to float
30/12/2019, 5:54 pm - +234 816 000 5595: U used rating not all_rating
30/12/2019, 5:54 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Check again

There won't be exercises however. You might have to find them yourself
30/12/2019, 6:10 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Newer pdfs will have exercises however
30/12/2019, 6:12 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Information overload
30/12/2019, 6:12 pm - +234 809 479 3406: True

30/12/2019, 6:13 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Nah! Maybe section 2. This is Data Quest's platform
30/12/2019, 6:14 pm - +234 809 828 1153: But Dataquest has a free python course
30/12/2019, 6:15 pm - +234 809 479 3406: If you apply for financial aid

30/12/2019, 9:16 pm - Opaino: Learning with Utiva i believe only laid a foundation for you to learn the Fundamental and doesn't make you a full fledged data analyst or scientist yet, so you will have to continue honing the skills through other resources, projects and many more
30/12/2019, 9:17 pm - Opaino: In general well done

Let the learning continue  👌

This is the answer o

If you are working on Day visualization then pick one data sets, clean it and try tell a story with it. You can write a blog about it or make noise on  display it on LinkedIn.

I heard it's great too 

@2348076691530 the boss of BI attest to it make you think like a consultant for those interested in Consulting aspect of Data Analytics like myself🌚
30/12/2019, 9:33 pm - Opaino: @2348083392756 

You can check out this too
30/12/2019, 9:36 pm - +234 809 479 3406: I applied already, and I got it. The first module involved cleaning of data, but I had a problem with writing the report. Perhaps you can help with that😌
30/12/2019, 9:37 pm - +234 809 479 3406: You should...definitely. You can also put it on LinkedIn as a job title😃
30/12/2019, 9:37 pm - Opaino: Me ke

You can reach out to @2347059273532  & @2348076691530  both of them completed it so they can give a first hand assistance better than me that only watched the 1st video and gave up

Some of us don't have the strength to code for long 😃

30/12/2019, 10:36 pm - +234 813 747 4240: Did you read it?
30/12/2019, 10:37 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Oga, go and sharpen your excel wella, you can save yourself a lot of time and stress using Excel, @2348108522573 can relate better.
30/12/2019, 10:38 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Flask is way easier for me than Django, Django just be like me going back to the Arabic school 🤣🤣🤣🤣
30/12/2019, 10:38 pm - Richie: as in...they don't know...till you boss tell you i need this in the next 1 seconds 🏃🏾‍♂

30/12/2019, 10:38 pm - Opaino: Well there times you don't need python actually because a simple Vlookup will get the job done why show yourself
30/12/2019, 10:39 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 🤣🤣🤣
30/12/2019, 10:39 pm - +234 813 747 4240: Lol..
30/12/2019, 10:40 pm - +234 813 747 4240: Thanks though
30/12/2019, 10:41 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Me playing with pandas when I need to extract some data from our database, I'm so fucking tired of coding that day, I just wrote a few code to connect to the postgresql server, used pd to extract the needed data, converted it to csv, and continue my work locally 🤣😅
30/12/2019, 10:41 pm - Omolade Ds: You're welcome😊
30/12/2019, 10:41 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Maybe in 2020.
But I don't see the need.
30/12/2019, 10:42 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Local man cannot go and come and kill himself.
30/12/2019, 10:42 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Lol..ok
30/12/2019, 10:42 pm - Richie: 👍

30/12/2019, 10:44 pm - Muhammed Analyst: You're sounding like my bro @2349058285150 some months ago 😅 🤣
30/12/2019, 10:44 pm - +234 809 479 3406: I'm a Medical student actually so there's no time for that😌
30/12/2019, 10:45 pm - +234 809 479 3406: 😂😂 Esteem issues
30/12/2019, 10:45 pm - Muhammed Analyst: With strong knowledge of Macros, you can easily build a mini app that takes care of most of your biometrics.
30/12/2019, 10:46 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Mm🤔. Will take a look
30/12/2019, 10:47 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I'm a graduate of Mathematics and Statistics, but proceeding with my MSc in *Biometry* (waiting on the admission list of UI)
30/12/2019, 10:48 pm - +234 706 499 0746: O God of data, when I go reach this stage
30/12/2019, 10:49 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I have transitioned from a Data Analyst to a Data Scientist, Data Scientist to a Junior Back End Developer (just a beginner though) and a Machine Learning Engineer (intermediate level though).
30/12/2019, 10:49 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Yeaz good to have this... Growth is too fast
30/12/2019, 10:49 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Pls, I am trying to converte ages in an excel column to integer e.g 20 years instead of having 1999-12-28


What code will I use?
30/12/2019, 10:50 pm - Muhammed Analyst: So I must say that I have a little idea of Data Science methodologies 😉🤣
30/12/2019, 10:50 pm - +234 809 479 3406: No wonder you're a boss
30/12/2019, 10:50 pm - +234 809 479 3406: 😂😂
30/12/2019, 10:50 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Lol
Don't be overwhelmed joor . It's not late. Infact, Data science never start for Nigeria. Trust me. Learn now and you will be glad you did when the AI revolution starts properly in Nigeria.
30/12/2019, 10:50 pm - +234 809 479 3406: I studied Biochemistry in my undergraduate level
30/12/2019, 10:50 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I'm just a novice fà
30/12/2019, 10:51 pm - Muhammed Analyst: This is for novice like me fà
30/12/2019, 10:51 pm - Muhammed Analyst: That's cool 😎
30/12/2019, 10:51 pm - +234 809 479 3406: What's the difference between a Data Scientist, and a Data Analyst? Wanna hear from you
30/12/2019, 10:51 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I'm telling you bro
30/12/2019, 10:52 pm - +234 706 499 0746: 👍
30/12/2019, 10:53 pm - Muhammed Analyst: As a Data Analyst, you necessarily don't have to be a programmer, just use your menu commands from your statistical packages such as SPSS, Stata, Minitab etc., while as a Data Scientist (AI specialist), you can't really run away from programming
30/12/2019, 10:53 pm - +234 706 499 0746: And business analyst... Thanks
30/12/2019, 10:54 pm - Muhammed Analyst: This is a brief summary of the difference between the two
30/12/2019, 10:54 pm - +234 817 190 1732: Very true
30/12/2019, 10:55 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Well I'm not well grounded in BI, though I have the basic knowledge of BI, but I'm not a fan of it, hence, I prefer not to talk about it, so my boss @2348108522573 won't flaw me 😉😅🤣
30/12/2019, 10:56 pm - Opaino: You can use =Years(cell)

Function in Excel or write a function that subtract the year from 2019 and return the difference
30/12/2019, 10:57 pm - +234 809 479 3406: This is easier done with python
30/12/2019, 10:57 pm - Opaino: The former is an Excel function while the later is using python
30/12/2019, 10:57 pm - Opaino: Well easier done with Excel or PowerBI because you won't write any function just a click 😃
30/12/2019, 10:58 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
30/12/2019, 10:58 pm - Opaino: Guess what i have learnt in the last 3 month?

FIND THE EASY WAY OUT


YOU DONT HAVE TO SHOW YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN WRITE CRAZY CODES😃

My boss instill that into me and I think it has been helpful
30/12/2019, 10:59 pm - Muhammed Analyst: In short, *not all data scientists are geek programmers*. Don't get discouraged if you can't code
30/12/2019, 11:00 pm - +234 806 840 6384: 👍
30/12/2019, 11:00 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
30/12/2019, 11:01 pm - +234 706 499 0746: @2348108522573
30/12/2019, 11:01 pm - Opaino: Andrew Ng report clarify that. 


Know your space 

Enjoy your space and learn it well 

Lastly, know the easy way out 😃😃


Any task now the 1st question I will I what is the easy way out even if I know the complex way because in the end what matter is solve the problem
30/12/2019, 11:01 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Leave coding for the men and let the guys take other aspects 😌😉😅
30/12/2019, 11:01 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
30/12/2019, 11:02 pm - +234 706 499 0746: 🔨 you hit the nail on the head
30/12/2019, 11:02 pm - +234 808 882 4940: That's exactly what I wnt... Python code????😭😭😢
30/12/2019, 11:03 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Excel misbehaving
30/12/2019, 11:03 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Fact is that I still use excel and Power BI at intervals, rather than writing codes when I'm lazy for that, I switch to BI
30/12/2019, 11:03 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Power BI*
30/12/2019, 11:03 pm - +234 809 479 3406: You have instilled it into me too😉.

As long as you get the job done, it doesn't matter what you use
30/12/2019, 11:04 pm - +234 809 479 3406: In a course I took, the man said it's not all Data Scientists that can code, and it's fine
30/12/2019, 11:04 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Please can you resend the link the course. Ejor
30/12/2019, 11:05 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Gaskiya, but not in some companies
30/12/2019, 11:05 pm - +234 809 479 3406: True
30/12/2019, 11:06 pm - +234 809 479 3406: There was a time I used slicers, and all then my excel closed😂
30/12/2019, 11:06 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Explain what you mean
30/12/2019, 11:06 pm - Muhammed Analyst: *INDICINA Group* uses Python for virtually all their analytics, my company uses Flask for deployment, if you're good in Django, you still have to learn Flask or you don't have a place here
30/12/2019, 11:07 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Some companies uses R instead of Python, a Python specialist does not have a place in such companies
30/12/2019, 11:08 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Rather than do web scraping, we build APIs in my company
30/12/2019, 11:09 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Wow! This is interesting
30/12/2019, 11:10 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Yeah
30/12/2019, 11:11 pm - Muhammed Analyst: My sincere advice is that don't jump at any offer because you really needed a job. Don't lie to a recruiter because you needed a job badly
30/12/2019, 11:11 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Mm
30/12/2019, 11:11 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Or we should just research them before applying
30/12/2019, 11:12 pm - Muhammed Analyst: @2348108522573 can relate our experience with c2g Consulting when we went for their interview around September
30/12/2019, 11:12 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Yeah
30/12/2019, 11:12 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Data science on Udemy no be data science for real life. Where will you even get the data to work on ? 

That analytics Vidhya post says it all
30/12/2019, 11:13 pm - +234 706 499 0746: But sometimes you may not know everything about them
30/12/2019, 11:13 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Reach out to one of the employees
30/12/2019, 11:13 pm - +234 808 882 4940: 🙄😀
30/12/2019, 11:14 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I had 3 companies offering me internship at the same time, but following the advice of my elder brother who is a *Cyber Security Specialist*, @2348108522573, @2348160589218 and some other mentors, I settled for my current company
30/12/2019, 11:14 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Then, establishb your own company and use whatsoever u r comfortable wth
30/12/2019, 11:14 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Why were they offering you internships? What attractive skills did you have?
30/12/2019, 11:15 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Even when the pay is not much, but looking at the prospect of the three companies, settled for my current company
30/12/2019, 11:15 pm - +234 809 479 3406: LOL! True that
30/12/2019, 11:15 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Rome wasn't built a day
30/12/2019, 11:15 pm - +234 813 533 2067: This remind me of the Ockham's razor.
30/12/2019, 11:15 pm - +234 706 499 0746: True but some companies recruit using third party
30/12/2019, 11:15 pm - +234 808 882 4940: Start consulting
30/12/2019, 11:16 pm - Opaino: Internships is your surest bet to get entry o
30/12/2019, 11:16 pm - Muhammed Analyst: You need to work with external parties to test run and certify your skills, nobody is looking for a novice
30/12/2019, 11:16 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Reach out to someone working as a data scientist or whatever
30/12/2019, 11:16 pm - +234 706 499 0746: 🚶🚶🚶 which one is razor again
30/12/2019, 11:16 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Mm! Interesting
30/12/2019, 11:16 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Yeah bro 😊
30/12/2019, 11:17 pm - Muhammed Analyst: No special skills
30/12/2019, 11:17 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Mad oh
30/12/2019, 11:17 pm - Opaino: I got to learn that "Skills" different from "Experience", you gain the later via working on real project while the former via personal development which I believe everyone is doing.
30/12/2019, 11:17 pm - Muhammed Analyst: The KPMG virtual Internship did played a vital role in helping me get opportunities easily
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Yeah
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - +234 706 499 0746: Hmmm
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - +234 809 479 3406: How?
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I stopped applying for jobs for a while now.
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - +234 706 499 0746: Bro show us the way
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
30/12/2019, 11:18 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Noted
30/12/2019, 11:19 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Python programming language is actually way easier than u guys thought....its JavaScript and co. that makes coding difficult to learn
30/12/2019, 11:19 pm - Muhammed Analyst: All the companies saw it on my profile, got in touch easily, gave me assessments each
30/12/2019, 11:19 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 🤣🤣🤣
30/12/2019, 11:20 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Noted. It's on my profile too
30/12/2019, 11:20 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Please can you explain more on this?
I have got my notebook and pen ready to learn.
30/12/2019, 11:20 pm - Muhammed Analyst: That's because you're a Python guy, same thing someone working with Java, C#, C++, etc. will say
30/12/2019, 11:20 pm - Opaino: Let's talk about this tomorrow

Gotta go

Work tomorrow o🏃🏿
30/12/2019, 11:20 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Haha, the simplest solution is the best solution.
30/12/2019, 11:21 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I'm out of Lag since last week, but working remotely
30/12/2019, 11:21 pm - Muhammed Analyst: One of the flexibility of my company 😉🤣
30/12/2019, 11:22 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Great, motivation aye
30/12/2019, 11:22 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Okay bro. I will remind you oh.
30/12/2019, 11:22 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Not just about that, the three companies gave me an assessment each and I had the same deadline for all three
30/12/2019, 11:22 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Soft work.
30/12/2019, 11:23 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I neglected one and attended to two
30/12/2019, 11:23 pm - Muhammed Analyst: INDICINA Group and my current company
30/12/2019, 11:23 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Madder oh. How did you solve this ?
30/12/2019, 11:24 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I used Power BI and Excel for INDICINA group, sent it to @2347030343362 for review before turning it in, and have to research on DL to solve the problem given to me by my company.
30/12/2019, 11:25 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Really, I would love to read from the pros in the house, their learning process from beginner to professional. 

We newbies can learn a thing or two from their stories.
30/12/2019, 11:25 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I have to technically build the model from scratch
30/12/2019, 11:25 pm - +234 808 325 6441: I asked a question about this y’all just ....
30/12/2019, 11:25 pm - +234 706 499 0746: 🤔
30/12/2019, 11:26 pm - Muhammed Analyst: INDICINA gave me some datasets to work with, while my company instructed that I source the data to work with by myself
30/12/2019, 11:26 pm - Muhammed Analyst: That week was one of my toughest week in 2019
30/12/2019, 11:26 pm - +234 706 499 0746: I think we need a meet-up too.... 🤔
30/12/2019, 11:27 pm - +234 706 499 0746: How do one source for data
30/12/2019, 11:27 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Analytic Vidhya, Github, Kaggle etc

30/12/2019, 11:28 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Awesome idea.
30/12/2019, 11:29 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I had my TPE exam for my MSc at UI on Monday, two of the companies reached out to me on Monday, the third reached out to me on Wednesday, the trio gave me a deadline of Sunday
30/12/2019, 11:30 pm - +234 706 499 0746: Waoh ...
30/12/2019, 11:30 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I had to prepare a 17 pages technical report under 3 hours for the model I built
30/12/2019, 11:30 pm - +234 813 533 2067: Mehn, that's a mental drudgery
30/12/2019, 11:31 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Yeah, as a Data Scientist, you must be ready to work under pressure
30/12/2019, 11:31 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Like it's really funny
30/12/2019, 11:31 pm - +234 813 533 2067: True, the timeline can be really short with voluminous workloads.
30/12/2019, 11:32 pm - +234 816 000 5595: That's why python skyrocket like that, its friendly for beginner...I spent just two month to grab all about it

30/12/2019, 11:37 pm - +234 708 531 6273: If you understand the underlying structure of programming, you can learn any language in 2 months. 

Concepts of OOP, Functions and all remains the same across board. The syntax is the only new thing and that can be learnt even in a month if you are serious with it
30/12/2019, 11:37 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Wow! How does one learn how to create reports?
30/12/2019, 11:38 pm - +234 809 479 3406: I had this problem when I started the KPMG virtual internship
30/12/2019, 11:38 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 🤣🤣🤣🤣

30/12/2019, 11:39 pm - Muhammed Analyst: It's an hereditary trait in my family, we're a family of writers, though we don't write commercially
30/12/2019, 11:40 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Yeah he's not lying, but I don't agree with him.
30/12/2019, 11:40 pm - +234 708 531 6273: It is the fact. Imagine a senior Java developer struggling to learn python? How far nah? What slows people down is understanding those new concepts (inheritance , Encapsulation and the rest) and data structure.

Mastering the syntax is nothing.

30/12/2019, 11:42 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Do you build ML models?
30/12/2019, 11:42 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Mastering syntax is really nothing, but working on ML models sometimes makes you look like a complete novice. I might be wrong, but people like @2349058285150 _et al_ can testify to this 👆

30/12/2019, 11:46 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I'm not arguing that, what I'm trying to make @2348160005595 understand is that Python is wide, not all Python developers are Data Scientists, in fact, some run away from DS, @2349058285150 can testify to this fact
30/12/2019, 11:47 pm - Muhammed Analyst: We all use these platforms
30/12/2019, 11:47 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Yea I know...they are diffrent
30/12/2019, 11:49 pm - +234 816 000 5595: But in two months u can learn all the python packages needed to be a data  scientists...do u agree with that?
30/12/2019, 11:49 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I just wanted you to correct the notion, though I'm just a novice at Python 🐍 😉
30/12/2019, 11:50 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Do you agree with me that Python modules are dynamic and not static?
30/12/2019, 11:51 pm - Muhammed Analyst: I'm not arguing this, you can learn pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc. but, their applications can be really intensive
30/12/2019, 11:52 pm - +234 816 000 5595: Most of the guys here wanted to be a data scientists not developer..they can learn all they need to learn about python packages for datascience ..we just need to encourage them..
30/12/2019, 11:54 pm - Muhammed Analyst: If you are not interested in the medical world, you might never have a cause to use *bio* which is a Python package for medicals. *GraphLab-Create* is used for building a recommender system and others, you might never have a cause to use it if your path doesn't cross across it.
30/12/2019, 11:54 pm - +234 809 479 3406: Yes, we need the encouragement😌
30/12/2019, 11:54 pm - +234 708 531 6273: ✅✅✅
30/12/2019, 11:55 pm - Muhammed Analyst: Well articulated, no one is discouraging anyone, we're all learners
30/12/2019, 11:55 pm - +234 809 479 3406: True
30/12/2019, 11:55 pm - +234 708 531 6273: Yup the list is endless. 
Let's say from a beginner to intermediate, two months straight will do
30/12/2019, 11:56 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
30/12/2019, 11:59 pm - +234 809 479 3406: When I took a Data Science course, the man said you don't need to learn everything. You just need to learn what you'll be using for what the industry you want to work in
30/12/2019, 11:59 pm - Muhammed Analyst: You just got my point, we don't need to give the newbies like I am false hopes, just as someone with 2 months of excel experience can't call himself a Data Analyst, someone with 2 months of experience in python for DS is really a junior, and permit me to say *an enthusiast*
30/12/2019, 11:59 pm - Muhammed Analyst: 💯 💯 💯
31/12/2019, 12:00 am - +234 809 479 3406: So it boils down to 'What industry do you want to go into?'🙂

31/12/2019, 11:16 am - Muhammed Analyst: Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid? 

I am a student from Nigeria and want to learn Version Control with Git. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Version Control with Git and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge. This course will help me in defining Version Control with Git, understanding how Version Control with Git could potentially impact our business and industry, to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Git, explain Version Control with Git to clients, friends, joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak. Identifying which aspects of Version Control with Git seem most important and relevant to us, Walking away with a strong foundation in where Git is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Version Control with Git course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past

Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.

The simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.
31/12/2019, 11:16 am - +234 802 916 2599: Good morning everyone. Thanks to the admins for this great opportunity.  Please i have a few questions. I am interested in data analytics. I have started taking a few courses online..  how much of statistics knowledge would i need along the way.  Would it be advisable to take courses on statistics before starting my data analytics journey or its something i can learn as i progress

31/12/2019, 11:25 am - +234 808 882 4940: I have this... My point is, Not getting a decline. 

Have been told before joining this group that if you enrol for the course b4 applying for financial aid, they won't grant the scholarship. Someone agreed to that here, but another person said no.

Here is the link to the Telegram page, so we can start migrating gradually.

Telegram offers more robust and flexible interface for  interaction.

- Messages can easily be traced 

- New comer won't lose any information

And many more.


Jan 1, 2020 all conversations will be 💯 on telegram, so for those that don't have telegram let's try and download. I will update the link in the post I made on linkedin to reflect the telegram page, so all new entrants join the telegram page directly.

02/01/2020, 3:38 pm - +234 806 513 1448: Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid? 

I am a student from Nigeria and want to learn Version Control with Git. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Version Control with Git and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge. This course will help me in defining Version Control with Git, understanding how Version Control with Git could potentially impact our business and industry, to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Git, explain Version Control with Git to clients, friends, joining a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak. Identifying which aspects of Version Control with Git seem most important and relevant to us, Walking away with a strong foundation in where Git is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Version Control with Git course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past

Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why.

The simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.
